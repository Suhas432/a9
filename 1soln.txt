CSS Flexbox Layout:

Definition: Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model that allows you to create a flexible and efficient way to distribute space among items within a container.
Direction: It primarily works along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically), and you can use properties like flex-direction to define the direction.
Alignment: It is well-suited for aligning items within a container and distributing space dynamically. Flexbox is great for building navigation bars, simple grids, and components that need to be aligned in a row or column.
CSS Grid Layout:

Definition: Grid is a two-dimensional layout model that enables you to create complex grid-based layouts with rows and columns.
Structure: It works with both rows and columns simultaneously, providing a more powerful and flexible layout system compared to Flexbox.
Alignment: It is particularly useful for creating overall page layouts where you have a grid structure, and you want to place items in specific locations within that grid. Grid is suitable for complex, multi-dimensional layouts.
Choosing Between Flexbox and Grid:

Flexibility: If you are working with a one-dimensional layout (either rows or columns), and you need to distribute space and align items along that axis, Flexbox might be a more natural choice.
Complex Layouts: If your layout requires a two-dimensional structure with both rows and columns, and you need precise control over the placement of items, CSS Grid is a powerful solution.
Combination: In many cases, both Flexbox and Grid can be used together. For example, you might use Flexbox within individual Grid items to arrange content within those items.
